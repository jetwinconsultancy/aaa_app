It applies generally to the ACT’s website and content and other related websites where this policy appears in the footer of the page. The policy that applies on any of our domains or subdomains is always the policy that appears in the footer of each website. By using ACT, you expressly consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is effective on August 1, 2018.</div>

Once you or your employer gives us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. If you choose to provide us with personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers. We may collect and store the following personal information:</div>

                        1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other third parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information (or about whom you are otherwise explicitly notified and consent to when using a specific service);<br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Law enforcement, governmental agencies, or authorized third-parties, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you, or any other ACT user to legal liability. In such events, we will disclose information relevant to the investigation, such as name, city, state, ZIP code, telephone number, email address, User ID history, IP &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;address, fraud complaints, and anything else we may deem relevant to the investigation; AND<br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other business entities, should we plan to merge with or be acquired by that business entity. (Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Policy with &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;respect to your personal information. If your personal information will be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice).<br>
                        </div>

                    	<div class="content_team_condition_bridge">Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy, we will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.</div>

                    	<div class="content_team_condition_bridge"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #D9A200">INFORMATION YOU SHARE ON ACT:</span> If you access our sites from a shared computer or a computer in an internet café, certain information about you, such as your User ID, activity or personal information, may also be visible to other individuals who use the computer after you. Be sure to properly log out of ACT to prevent this possibility.</div>

                    	<div class="content_team_condition_bridge"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #D9A200">NO SPAM, SPYWARE OR SPOOFING:</span> We do not tolerate spam. Make sure to set your ACT communication preferences so we may communicate to you as you prefer. To report ACT-related spam or spoof emails to ACT, please forward the email to <span style="color: #D9A200">enquiry@acumenbizcorp.com.sg</span>. You may not use our communication tools to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate our User Agreement. We automatically scan and may manually filter messages to check for spam, viruses, phishing attacks and other malicious activity or illegal or prohibited content, but we do not permanently store messages sent through these tools. We do not rent or sell email addresses.</div>

                    	<div class="content_team_condition_bridge"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #D9A200">ACCOUNT PROTECTION:</span> Your password is the key to your account. Use unique numbers, letters and/or special characters, and do not disclose your ACT password to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account. If your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password.</div>

                    	<div class="content_team_condition_bridge"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #D9A200">ACCESSING, REVIEWING AND CHANGING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION:</span> You can see, review and change most of your personal information by signing on to ACT. Generally, we will not manually modify your personal information because it is very difficult to verify your identity remotely. You must update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate, per your Employer’s practices and policies.</div>

                    	<div class="content_team_condition_bridge"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #D9A200">SECURITY:</span> Your information is stored on our servers. We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use lots of tools (encryption, passwords, etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, as you probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.</div>

                    	<div class="content_team_condition_bridge"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #D9A200">THIRD PARTIE:</span> Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. ACT does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.</div>
